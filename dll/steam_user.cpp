// so the uncompressed audio could have a shorter duration than you expect.
// There may be no data at all during long periods of silence. Also, fetching
// uncompressed audio will cause GetVoice to discard any leftover compressed
// audio, so you must fetch both types at once. Finally, GetAvailableVoice is
// not precisely accurate when the uncompressed size is requested. So if you
// really need to use uncompressed audio, you should call GetVoice frequently
// with two very large (20kb+) output buffers instead of trying to allocate
// perfectly-sized buffers. But most applications should ignore all of these
// details and simply leave the "uncompressed" parameters as NULL/zero.

// Compressed data can be transmitted by your application and decoded into raw
